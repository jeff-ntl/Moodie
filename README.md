# Moodie 

## About
 A diary app (student project) allows you to not only perform basic CRUD function. It also displays your moods (happy, neutral, sad, angry) in a piechart. Users can also take photo and add it as part of their diary. Other than that, user will also received a notification at 10pm (GMT +8) everyday as a reminder to write diary.

## Naming
The reason why I named it as Moodie is because of the main feature of the diary app: picking a mood in your diary. It is also a word play with the online educational platform used in WIT -- "Moodle".
